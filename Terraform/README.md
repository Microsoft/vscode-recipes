# Running Terraform in VS Code

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source tool that provides the ability to write infrastructure as code using declarative configuration files using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). This recipe shows how to successfully run Terraform with minimal setup with VS Code.

## Getting Started

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html): Download the latest version of Terraform that is appropriate for your environment.

- [Terraform Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform): The HashiCorp Terraform VS Code extension adds syntax highlighting and other editing features for Terraform files using the Terraform Language Server.
